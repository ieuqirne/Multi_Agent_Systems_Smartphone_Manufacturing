# SET1111_Smartphone_Manufacturing_Coursework

Manufacturing companies are typically part of a supply chain, in which they must
take customer orders, procure the materials to fulfil the order, assemble the materials
into the final product, and then ship the product to the customer. Multi-agent systems
are increasingly being used to automate this process by handling negotiations with
customers and suppliers, and scheduling production to meet demand.

This coursework has two tasks. Your first task is to design and implement a multiagent system in JADE to model the smartphone manufacturing supply chain scenario
specified below. Your design should include an ontology suitable for the problem
domain, and appropriate use of the FIPA communication language for agent
interactions. 
Your second task is to design and experimentally evaluate a control
strategy for the manufacturer agent in your model, with the goal of maximising the
monetary profit that the manufacturer receives.
